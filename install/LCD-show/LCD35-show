# This file is a part of TorBox, an easy to use anonymizing router based on Raspberry Pi.

#
# DESCRIPTION
# This file installs the support for no-name 3.5â€³ TFTs.
#
# SYNTAX
# ./LCD35-show <rotation>
#
# Optional, the <rotation> can be changed to 0, 90, 180 and 270, respectively representing
# rotation angles of 0 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees.
#
###### SET VARIABLES ######
# How many degrees should the display output be rotated? We set a prefix of 90 degrees
# because using 0 means that we will have it landscape, not portrait.
rotate=90+$i


# Original - supports only kernel 4.9.*
# sudo cp ./usr/tft35a-overlay.dtb /boot/overlays/
# sudo cp ./usr/tft35a-overlay.dtb /boot/overlays/tft35a.dtbo

# By MrYacha - supports kernel 5.4.*
sudo cp ./usr/waveshare35a.dtbo /boot/overlays/

# Final statement
# We know that we have to improfe our script and how we possibly responsible configure a system, but the installations script handed out by LCD-show is REALLY of lousy quality. They
# are overwriting configuration files and put things in it, which are not necessary -- at least not for working with TorBox. The following sources help to understand what is essential
# when it comes to configuring a TFT display with LCD-show:
