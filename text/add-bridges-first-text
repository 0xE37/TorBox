Currently, no bridges are configured. Bridges are necessary for TorBox to bypass Tor blocking in a country. With the help of this dialog-based configuration assistant, 3-5 bridges can easily be added. When adding more than 5 bridges, it is recommended to use the advanced configuration editor (menu entry 8).

HOW TO OBTAIN BRIDGES?
You have two ways to obtain the necessary bridge-addresses:
1. Get them here https://bridges.torproject.org/
   (chose "Advanced Options", "obfs4" and press "Get Bridges)
2. Or send an email to bridges@torproject.org, using an address
   from Riseup, Gmail or Yahoo with "get transport obfs4" in the
   body of the mail.
