You choose to connect your TorBox with a wireless network. For this purpose, it is necessary to connect to the wireless network intended for use. The following easy to use program intends to help you with that.

IMPORTANT
Your Raspberry Pi needs to have enough power (see here: https://www.torbox.ch/?page_id=112#power), and the USB WiFi adapter must not need to much power to work correctly (see here https://www.torbox.ch/?page_id=112#wicd). If not, the process sticks at "Validating authentification" or breaks completely. If the process sticks at "Obtaining IP address", try to connect a second time or to reboot after you completed the configuration mentioned below. Repeat the process a second time; with a little bit luck the network is already connected and set up during the boot. If nothing helps, try to reset the network manager (entry 12 in the countermeasure & troubleshooting submenu) and/or use a simpler, low powered USB WiFi adapter.

DESCRIPTION
After the program has started, the list with available wireless networks is refreshed two or three times -- please be patient. Afterward, choose the specific wireless network with the up-/down-arrow-keys and press the right-arrow-key. IN ALL CASES, activate "Use these settings for all networks sharing this essid" and "Automatically connect to this network". If necessary, toggle "Use encryption" on, usually select "WPA 1/2 (Passphrase)" and write the password in the field below. Save with SHIFT-S.

Check again, if the designated wireless network is still selected and press ENTER or SHIFT-C. Wait a minute or two. The connection was successful if you can read "Connected to..." in the left corner.

Press OK, if you are ready to continue...
