This menu entry deactivates the BRIDGE RELAY MODE of TorBox. This is the default.

However, the used configuration will not be deleted. If you activate the BRIDGE RELAY MODE again, the same configuration is applied -- no need to worry ;-)

In the end, Tor automatically restarts.

Would you like to DEACTIVATE the BRIDGE RELAY MODE of TorBox?
