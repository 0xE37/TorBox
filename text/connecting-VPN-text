We will connect the TorBox to a VPN so that the local network data from the command prompt is routed through VPN. However, tor will not restart, and your client network data will still be routed through tor using the interface highlighted in the main menu.

IMPORTANT
- To use this menu entry, you have first to put one or more *.ovpn-files
  in the ~/openvpn directory so that TorBox can execute OpenVPN with
  that file.

Would you like to CONTINUE?
