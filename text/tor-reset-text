This resets Tor, meaning:
- deactivate the use of bridges and the bridge relay,
- delete all circuits and force a change of the permanent entry node,
- delete the Tor statistics.

We will NOT...
...delete or reset the configuration files,
...delete your bridges,
...delete your bridge relay, (hashed) fingerprints etc.

Are you sure to reset Tor?
