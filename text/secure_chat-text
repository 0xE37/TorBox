This menu entry starts, stops or lists TorBox Chat Secure (TCS) on Onion domains.

IMPORTANT
- To use TCS, you have first to toggle the Onion Service Mode from OFF to
  ON and/or create an Onion Service (menu entry 2 or 3).
- Without client authorization (menu entry 7-11), you will share the
  website folder with ANYONE. If you don't want that, control the
  client's access first.

Do you want to start, stop or list TCS on Onion domains?
