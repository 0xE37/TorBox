In highly authoritarian countries connecting the tor network could be seen as suspicious. Bridges with pluggable transports hide the connection to the tor network. However, we recommend only using this option if necessary because it is slower and doesn't work if you are behind a tightly configured firewall.

The most important bridges are OBFS4 and SNOWFLAKE. OBFS4 is more performant and works well in countries with moderate internet censorship. For China, Iran, Russia or Turkmenistan, we recommend using SNOWFLAKE (see also here: https://github.com/radio24/TorBox/discussions/179).

If using bridges will not result in a working Tor network connection, TorBox will start the Countermeasure sub-menu, where you can also try MEEK-AZURE or reconfigure OBFS4 / SNOWFLAKE bridges.

Again, we highlight that if your well-being depends on your anonymity, it is strongly advised not to use TorBox, but Tails!

Are you in a highly authoritarian country and need to ACTIVATE bridges with pluggable transports for TorBox (default is NO)?
