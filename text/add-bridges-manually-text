With this menu entry, you can ADD BRIDGES MANUALLY. Bridges are necessary for TorBox to bypass Tor blocking in a country. However, adding bridges is not enough - if not already done - you have to activate the OBFS4 BRIDGE MODE of TorBox (menu entry 2).

With the help of this dialogue-based configuration assistant, 3-5 bridges can easily be added. When adding more than five bridges, it is recommended to use the advanced configuration editor (menu entry 8).

HOW TO OBTAIN BRIDGES?
With TorBox, you have three ways to obtain bridges:
1. Obtain about every 24h one bridge automatically.
2. Get them here: https://bridges.torproject.org/
   (chose "Advanced Options", "obfs4" and press "Get Bridges).
3. Send an email to bridges@torproject.org, using an address from Riseup
   or Gmail with "get transport obfs4" in the body of the mail.
