This menu entry stores a backup of your ONION SERVICE configuration in /home/torbox/backup.

You can access this backup file by downloading it from your TorBox using a SFTP client (it uses the same login and password as your SSH client). Alternatively, you can retrieve the backup file by connecting an USB stick to your TorBox. You can probably mount the USB stick by “sudo mount /dev/sda /mnt” and then copy the backup file on your stick.

With that backup, it is possible to upgrade a TorBox with Onion Service support or move it to another computer to keep all the configuration, keys, and data. Keeping backups of your Onion Services is the recommended way to ensure the availability of your data in case of a system crash.

IMPORTANT
- If you choose to make a backup of your shared folders, you need enough
  space on your SD card.
- In any case, we will link all your shared folders into your backup
  directory so that you can easily copy all your shared data without
	making a backup, which will probably exceed the SD card space.
- An already existing backup in the home directory will be overwritten
  without confirmation!
