BRIDGES, which support pluggable transports, help Tor to circumvent sophisticated censorship. Regarding pluggable transports, TorBox currently supports only OBFS4, because it is to date the most effective transport to bypass censorship (meek-azure probably follows later).

3-STEP PROCEDURE
To get bridges working in TorBox, you have to follow a 3-step procedure:
1. Activate the BRIDGE MODE (menu entry 2).
2. Activate already configured bridges or add/replace new bridges.
3. Restart Tor.

HOW TO OBTAIN BRIDGES?
With TorBox, you have three ways to obtain bridges:
1. Obtain about every 24h one bridge automatically (menu entry 4).
2. Get them here: https://bridges.torproject.org/
   (chose "Advanced Options", "obfs4" and press "Get Bridges).
3. Send an email to bridges@torproject.org, using an address from Riseup
   or Gmail with "get transport obfs4" in the body of the mail.

HOW DO I KNOW IF IT IS WORKING?
PLEASE BE PATIENT! The process to build circuits could last for several minutes, depending on your network and the contacted bridge relay! In the end, you should see "Bootstrapped 100%: Done" (menu entry 9 or 11).

HOW CAN I CHECK THE VALIDITY OF A BRIDGE?
Use menu entry 3 or go to https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html and search for the fingerprint (this is the long number between the ip:port and cert=). Tor Metrics should then show you the information of that particular server. If it doesn't show up, the bridge is no longer valid.
