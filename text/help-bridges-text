BRIDGES, which support pluggable transports, help Tor to circumvent sophisticated censorship.

We differentiate between OBFS4 bridges and MEEK-AZURE.

3-STEP PROCEDURE TO ACTIVATE OBFS4 BRIDGES
To get OBFS4 bridges working in TorBox, you have to follow a 3-step procedure:
1. Activate the OBFS4 BRIDGE MODE (menu entry 2).
2. Activate already configured bridges or add/replace new bridges.
3. Restart Tor.

HOW TO OBTAIN OBFS4 BRIDGES?
With TorBox, you have three ways to obtain bridges:
1. Obtain about every 24h one bridge automatically (menu entry 4).
2. Get them here: https://bridges.torproject.org/
   (chose "Advanced Options", "obfs4" and press "Get Bridges).
3. Send an email to bridges@torproject.org, using an address from Riseup
   or Gmail with "get transport obfs4" in the body of the mail.

HOW CAN I CHECK THE VALIDITY OF A OBFS4 BRIDGE?
Use menu entry 3 or go to https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html and search for the fingerprint (this is the long number between the ip:port and cert=). Tor Metrics should then show you the information of that particular server. If it doesn't show up, the bridge is no longer valid.

HOW TO ACTIVATE MEEK-AZURE?
Just use the menu entry 10.

HOW DO I KNOW IF IT IS WORKING?
PLEASE BE PATIENT! The process to build circuits could last for several minutes, depending on your network! In the end, you should see "Bootstrapped 100%: Done" (menu entry 9).
