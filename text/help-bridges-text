BRIDGES, which support pluggable transports, help Tor to circumvent sophisticated censorship. Regarding pluggable transports, TorBox currently supports only OBFS4, because it is to date the most effective transport to bypass censorship (meek-azure probably follows later).

3-STEP PROCEDURE
To get bridges working in TorBox, you have to follow a 3-step procedure:
1. Activate the BRIDGE MODE (menu entry 2).
2. Activate already configured bridges or add/replace new bridges.
3. Restart Tor (menu entry 9) or check Tor log (menu entry 11).

HOW TO OBTAIN BRIDGES?
You have two ways to obtain the necessary bridge-addresses:
1. Get them here https://bridges.torproject.org/
   (chose "Advanced Options", "obfs4" and press "Get Bridges)
2. Or send an email to bridges@torproject.org, using an address
   from Riseup, Gmail or Yahoo with "get transport obfs4" in the
   body of the mail.

HOW DO I KNOW IF IT IS WORKING?
PLEASE BE PATIENT! The process to build circuits could last for several minutes, depending on your network and the contacted bridge server! In the end, you should see "Bootstrapped 100%: Done" (menu entry 9 or 11).

HOW CAN I CHECK THE VALIDITY OF A BRIDGE?
Go to https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html and search for the fingerprint (this is the long number between the ip:port and cert=). Tor Metrics should then show you the information of that particular server. If it doesn't show up, the bridge is no longer valid.
