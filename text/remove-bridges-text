This menu entry REMOVES all or specific OBFS4 BRIDGES from TorBox. However, OBFS4 Bridges are necessary for TorBox to bypass Tor blocking in a country. To use this feature of TorBox, you need to have at least one OBFS4 bridge.

IMPORTANT
If you remove ALL OBFS4 bridges, TorBox will directly connect to the Tor network, which is the default.
However, instead of removing OBFS4 bridges, we recommend simply to deactivate them.
