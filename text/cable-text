This menu entry supposes that TorBox is connected with the internet through
the onboard ethernet interface (cable).

The next step is to setup TorBox so that your client devices have access
through TorBox's wireless network. However, if you also like to access
through a USB ethernet adapter, then please plug in the adapter and
connect the ethernet cable with your client device, NOW.

If we have to restart TorBox's wireless network, then please reconnect your
client without closing the ssh session. Usually, the configuration
continuous -- if not, then please repeat the process.

Would you like to CONTINUE?
