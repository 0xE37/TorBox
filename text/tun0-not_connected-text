It seems that TorBox is not connected to the Internet yet!

If you want to connect TorBox with a cable to the Internet, you should already have plugged in the ethernet cable. If not, do it now and press CONTINUE.

If you must connect the TorBox with another wireless network (usually through a USB wireless adapter), choose CONNECT WLAN.
