This menu entry supposes that TorBox is connected with the internet through
an USB WiFi adapter. Often, USB WiFi adapters support only the 2.5 GHz
band. For that reason, another menu entry gives you the possibility to
connect the internet through the onboard wireless chip, which also supports
the 5 GHz band.

The next step is to setup TorBox so that your client devices have access
through TorBox's wireless network. However, if you also like to access
through the onboard ethernet interface (cable), then please plug in the
cable with your client device, NOW.

If we have to restart TorBox's wireless network, then please reconnect your
client without closing the ssh session. Usually, the configuration
continuous -- if not, then please repeat the process.
