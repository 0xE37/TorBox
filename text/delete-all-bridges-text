With this menu entry, you can DELETE ALL OBFS4 BRIDGES. However, OBFS4 bridges are necessary for TorBox to bypass Tor blocking in a country. After deleting all OBFS4 bridges, you should add new OBFS4 bridges again.

IMPORTANT
If ALL OBFS4 bridges are removed, TorBox will directly connect to the Tor network, which is the default.
