An Onion Service could be used to serve a website folder (menu entry 17 or 18). The served data will be publicly available without activated client authorization (menu entry 7-11). This behaviour may not be the intention of the service operator. However, with a key pair (public and private key), access to an Onion Service can be limited to those with the private key.

If the client sends a public key to the onion service operator, this menu entry will register this public key for a particular Onion Service. The onion service operator doesn't have to send anything to the client - the client already has the private key.

Alternatively, the onion service operator can generate a new key pair (public and private key) with menu entry 7.

Would you like to register a public key from a client for a specific Onion Service?
