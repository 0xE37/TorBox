There are two ways to connect with the Internet: through OPEN ACCESS or CAPTIVE PORTAL.

OPEN ACCESS means that after TorBox is connected to the Internet via cable or a wireless connection (possibly with a password), you don't have to fill out an additional login/authentication page. Usually, this is the case when you are at home.

CAPTIVE PORTAL means that after TorBox is connected to the Internet via cable or a wireless connection (possibly without a password), you have to register yourself with additional information (for example email, phone number, voucher number ...) on an additional login page (captive portal). This is often seen at airports and in hotels as well as Internet caf√©es ...

Please choose how you have to connect the Internet (if unsure, try CAPTIVE PORTAL - it is more complex, but works in both cases).
