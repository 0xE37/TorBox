MEEK-AZURE circumvents sophisticated censorship. In contrast to the OBFS4 bridges (see menu entries above), MEEK-AZURE is based on another technique. However, because it has a bandwidth limitation, this it will be quite slow.

You should only activate MEEK-AZURE, if necessary and if OBFS4 bridges and SNOWFLAKE don't work. By default, MEEK-AZURE is deactivated.

IMPORTANT
- This menu entry activates MEEK-AZURE to bypass Tor blocking in a
  country. It helps to circumvent censorship; however, it doesn't help if
  a firewall blocks the network traffic.
- OBFS4 BRIDGE, BRIDGE RELAY MODE and SNOWFLAKE will automatically be
	deactivated; the configuration will be kept for later re-activation.
- The countermeasure against tightly configured firewalls will
  automatically be deactivated, and local clearnet DNS resolution will
	be activated. However, this is not a problem because all clients'
	DNS requests are still handled through Tor.
- Ignore error messages! In the end, you should see
  "Bootstrapped 100%: Done".
- Tor statistics (and probably some other tools) will not work under
  MEEK-AZURE.
