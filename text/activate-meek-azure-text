MEEK-AZURE circumvents sophisticated censorship. In contrast to the OBFS4 bridges (see menu entries above), MEEK-AZURE is based on another technique. However, because it has a bandwidth limitation, it will be pretty slow.

You should only activate MEEK-AZURE, if necessary and if OBFS4 bridges and SNOWFLAKE don't work. By default, MEEK-AZURE is deactivated.

IMPORTANT
- This menu entry activates MEEK-AZURE to bypass Tor blocking in a
  country. It helps to circumvent censorship; however, it doesn't help if
  a firewall blocks the network traffic.
- To run correctly, MEEK-AZURE has to resolve DNS requests and connect
  some URLs directly. It is not a problem because all client's DNS
	requests and data are still handled through the tor network.
	However, your network provider may see that you are using tor.
- OBFS4 BRIDGE, BRIDGE RELAY MODE, SNOWFLAKE and countermeasures against
  tightly configured firewalls will automatically be deactivated; the
  configuration will be kept for later re-activation.
- Ignore error messages! In the end, you should see
  "Bootstrapped 100%: Done".
- Tor statistics (and probably some other tools) will not work under
  MEEK-AZURE.
