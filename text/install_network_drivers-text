This should install/update the additional network drivers for Realtek 8188eu, 8188fu, 8192eu, 8812au, 8814au, 8821au, 8821cu, and 8822bu.

IMPORTANT
- if this is not a fresh installation but an update of an existing
  installation, it is recommended to update the base system first
  (menu entry 1) and to reboot.

Would you really like to install/update the additional network drivers (the default is YES)?
