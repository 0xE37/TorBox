This entry will exclude a specific domain (for example, netflix.com) from being routed through tor. It means that the IP address of this site will be accessed directly or through a VPN. You have to assume that everyone will see that you access this site and may even see the content of the communication.

If the domain is already in the exclusion list, then the domain can be changed as follow:
- Rescan and add more subdomains and IPs connected to the domain.
- Change the kind of exclusion list (direct access or through a VPN).
- Remove the domain and its IPs.
