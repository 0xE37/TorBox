This menu entry supposes that TorBox is connected with the internet
through a VPN connection using the interface tun0. There are two
possibilities of how TorBox handles VPN connections:

1. The VPN connection is already established, and the interface tun0 is
   configured.

2. The VPN connection is not established yet, but one ore more *.ovpn
   - files are in the ~/openvpn directory so that TorBox can execute
   OpenVPN with that file.

IMPORTANT
- We do NOT recommend using a VPN. If Tor entry guards cannot be reached
  for censorship reasons, we recommend using OBFS4 bridges as a priority
  (main menu entry 10). We consider a VPN connection as a last resort.
- Nevertheless, we consider the additional risk of this "Tor over VPN"
  situation  to be proportionate - see here: https://bit.ly/31lUhLQ

The next step is to setup TorBox so that your client devices have access
through TorBox's wireless network. However, if you also like to access
through the onboard ethernet interface (cable), please plug in the cable
with your client device, NOW.

If we have to restart TorBox's wireless network, then please reconnect
your client without closing the ssh session. Usually, the configuration
continuous -- if not, then please repeat the process.

Would you like to CONTINUE?
