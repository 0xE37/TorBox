This menu entry supposes that TorBox is connected with the internet
through a VPN connection. There are two possibilities of how TorBox handles
VPN connections:

1. The VPN connection is already established, and the interface tun0 is
   configured.
2. The VPN connection is not yet established, but a *.ovpn - file is in the
   ~/openvpn directory so that TorBox can execute OpenVPN with that file.

IMPORTANT
- We do NOT recommend using a VPN. If Tor entry guards cannot be reached
  for censorship reasons, we recommend using OBFS4 bridges as a priority
  (main menu entry 10). We consider a VPN connection as a last resort.
- Nevertheless, we consider the additional risk of this "Tor over VPN"
  situation  to be proportionate - see here: https://bit.ly/31lUhLQ
- Depending on your configuration and your VPN provider, local DNS
  resolution may not work. This does not affect the clients because
  their DNS resolution is routed through the Tor network. However,
  probably you are unable to execute some menu points in the TorBox menu
  when a local Internet connection with working DNS resolution is mandatory.

The next step is to setup TorBox so that your client devices have access
through TorBox's wireless network. However, if you also like to access
through the onboard ethernet interface (cable), please plug in the cable
with your client device, NOW.

If we have to restart TorBox's wireless network, then please reconnect your
client without closing the ssh session. Usually, the configuration
continuous -- if not, then please repeat the process.
