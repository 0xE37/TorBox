This menu entry supposes that TorBox is connected with the internet through
the onboard wireless chip, which also supports the 5 GHz band. Because
most USB WiFi adapters don't support the 5 GHz band, we may reduce TorBox's
wireless network to 2.5 GHz 20 MHz. However, you can always increase the
values at any time afterward using the configuration sub-menu.

The settings are automatically reset to the default values with the next
reboot to ensure that you can access the TorBox even without a USB WiFi
adapter.

The next step is to setup TorBox so that your client devices have access
through TorBox's wireless network. However, if you also like to access
through the onboard ethernet interface (cable), then please plug in the
cable with your client device, NOW.

If we have to restart TorBox's wireless network, then please reconnect your
client without closing the ssh session. Usually, the configuration
continuous -- if not, then please repeat the process.

Would you like to CONTINUE?
