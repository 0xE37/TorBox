With this menu entry, you can REMOVE SELECTED BRIDGES from the Tor configuration. However, bridges are necessary for TorBox to bypass Tor blocking in a country. After deleting all bridges, you should either add new bridges or deactivate the OBFS4 BRIDGE MODE entirely.

2-STEP PROCEDURE
To remove selected bridges, you have to follow a 2-step procedure:
1. List all bridges (menu entry 3) and make a note of all bridge numbers
   you want to remove.
2. Continue with this menu entry and put in all bridge numbers separated
   by a comma, which you want to remove (for example: 1,2,3,10)
