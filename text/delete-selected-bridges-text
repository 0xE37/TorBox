With this menu entry, you can REMOVE selected OBFS4 BRIDGES from the Tor configuration. However, OBFS4 bridges are necessary for TorBox to bypass Tor blocking in a country. After deleting all OBFS4 bridges, you should add new bridges again.

2-STEP PROCEDURE
To remove selected OBFS4 bridges, you have to follow a 2-step procedure:
1. List all OBFS4 bridges and make a note of all bridge numbers you want
   to remove.
2. Continue with this menu entry and put in all bridge numbers separated
   by a comma, which you want to remove (for example: 1,2,3,10)
