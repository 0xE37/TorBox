This menu entry REMOVES selected bridges. However, bridges are necessary for TorBox to bypass Tor blocking in a country. To use this feature of TorBox, you need at least one bridge. After deleting all bridges, you should add new bridges again.

IMPORTANT
WITH REMOVING ALL BRIDGES, TorBox will directly connect to the Tor network, which is the default. However, instead of removing bridges, we recommend deactivating them.
