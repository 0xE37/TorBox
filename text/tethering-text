This menu entry supposes that TorBox is connected with the internet
through tethering or an USB ethernet adapter. These interfaces have to be
configured BEFOREHAND. For example, with an iPhone: Unlock your iPhone,
but let the personal hotspot disabled for the time being and connect it
with the TorBox. Choose to trust your iPhone (necessary!). Enable personal
hotspot on your iPhone (USB only) and continue with the configuration.

IMPORTANT
Usually, the tethering device (Smartphone) is charging its battery while
connected with the USB port. This can lead to a unstable system. A better
solution may be to create a personal hotspot with your smartphone instead
of using tethering.

The next step is to setup TorBox so that your client devices have access
through TorBox's wireless network. However, if you also like to access
through the onboard ethernet interface (cable), then please plug in the
cable with your client device, NOW.

If we have to restart TorBox's wireless network, then please reconnect your
client without closing the ssh session. Usually, the configuration
continuous -- if not, then please repeat the process.
