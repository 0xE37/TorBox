In highly authoritarian countries connecting the tor network could be seen as suspicious. The default hostname of TorBox is "TorBox<nnn>" (<nnn> representing the version).

When a computer connects to an ISP's network, it sends a DHCP request that includes the hostname. Because ISPs can see, log and even block hostnames, setting another hostname or using a randomized hostname may be preferable.

We recommend randomizing the hostname in highly authoritarian countries or if you think that your ISP blocks tor related network traffic.

Your current hostname is: HOSTNAMEANKER

Do you want to CHANGE it?
