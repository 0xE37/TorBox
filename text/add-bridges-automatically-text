With this menu entry, you can ADD BRIDGES AUTOMATICALLY. Bridges are necessary for TorBox to bypass Tor blocking in a country. However, adding bridges is not enough - if not already done - you have to activate the BRIDGE MODE of TorBox (menu entry 2).

IMPORTANT
For security reasons, only one bridge is acquired about every 24 hours.
