You choose to update to the newest stable version of Tor. This menu entry
is a fall-back option if something goes wrong, and menu entry 1 didn't
update Tor correctly. It fetches the source package from the Tor repository
and compiles it on the Raspberry Pi. Usually, you should update the entire
base system (menu entry 1).

IMPORTANT
- Don't remove power from your TorBox during the update.
- The TorBox menu has to be updated separately.

Duration: up to 30 minutes
