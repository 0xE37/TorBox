This menu entry supposes that TorBox is connected with the internet through
a cellular link (for example, the Sixfab Shields/HATs for cellular
connections) or a USB dongle. These interfaces have to be configured
BEFOREHAND.

The next step is to setup TorBox so that your client devices have access
through TorBox's wireless network. However, if you also like to access
through the onboard ethernet interface (cable), then please plug in the
cable with your client device, NOW.

If we have to restart TorBox's wireless network, then please reconnect your
client without closing the ssh session. Usually, the configuration
continuous -- if not, then please repeat the process.

Would you like to CONTINUE?
