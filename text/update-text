You choose to update the base system of your TorBox and to upgrade to the latest stable tor release.

IMPORTANT
- Don't remove power from your TorBox during the update.
- If you close your terminal or if you lose network connectivity to
  your TorBox during the update process then stay cool. The update
  runs within a "screen" session, meaning that the update is completed
  even if the terminal is closed.
- After waiting several minutes, you can re-attach your terminal with
  the screen session:
  - Log into your TorBox
  - Leave the menu with the ESC key
  - At the command line execute the following command: screen -x
- You have to reboot the system to load the new kernel

Duration: up to 60 minutes
