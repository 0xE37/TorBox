You choose to update the base system of your TorBox and/or to upgrade to the latest stable tor release.

IMPORTANT
- Don't remove power from your TorBox during the update.
- If you close your terminal or if you lose network connectivity to
  your TorBox during the update process, then stay calm. The update
  runs within a "screen" session, meaning that the update is completed
  even if the terminal is closed.
- After waiting several minutes, you can re-attach your terminal with
  the screen session:
  - Log into your TorBox
  - Leave the menu with the ESC key
  - At the command line execute the following command: screen -x
- You have to reboot the system to load a new kernel.
- TorBox (the menu and the configuration) have to be updated separately
  with the entries 3 and 4.

Duration: up to 45 minutes
