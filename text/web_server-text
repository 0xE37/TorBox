This menu entry will start, stop or list website folders on Onion domains.

IMPORTANT
- To share a website folder through an Onion domain, you have first to
  toggle the Onion Service Mode from OFF to ON and/or create an Onion
  Service (menu entry 2 or 3).
- Without client authorization (menu entry 7-11), you will share the
  website folder to ANYONE. If you don't want that, control client's
  access first.
