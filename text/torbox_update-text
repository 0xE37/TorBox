Would you like to update your TorBox?

IMPORTANT
- Currently, this update is only recommended for minor updates within a
  version. If you like to upgrade from one version to another, we recommend
  to downloading the new image file.
- By default, only the TorBox menu will be upgraded. To upgrade the
  configuration files additionally select menu entry 6.
- If you selected menu entry 6 to update / reset your TorBox configuration
  files, all configuration files would be overwritten, and all your custom
  configuration will be lost (we will not ask you a second time!)
