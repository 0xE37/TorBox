DONE!

We removed all bridges in the tor configuration, fetched and added bridges used as default built-in bridges in the TorBrowser.

However, we didn't restart tor because currently, all bridges are DEACTIVATED!

If you need bridges, configure them first in the Countermeasure sub-menu and only after that restart tor.
