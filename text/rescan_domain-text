This menu entry will rescan the domain already on the domain exclusion list. The rescan may generate more subdomains and/or IPs for this domain. A rescan could be necessary if subdomains or not added IPs of the domain are occasionally still routed through tor.

After the rescan, which can take some time, the existing domain entries can be replaced or complemented.

It is important that during the rescan, the domain is used as usual on the client because the rescan is listening to DNS requests on the client interface. However, this can be a bit challenging because your client browser or/and the operating system usually cache the DNS response (the IP address) for some time. Using another browser to connect will help.

The rescan automatically stops when it has enough data.
