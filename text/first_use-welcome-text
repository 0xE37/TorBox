Congratulation, you got TorBox running!

TorBox didn't connect the Tor network yet, but it will do so after the
next start-up dialogue boxes, which will ask you the following:
- if you want to use a (default) firewall circumvention method;
- from where the Internet is coming;
- if you want to activate the TorBox automatic counter actions;
- if you want to use OBFS4 or SNOWFLAKE bridges;
- and if you want to install additional network drivers.

Leaving now, for security reasons, tor will stay BLOCKED to communicate with the Internet. However, if needed, you can rerun the script using the Update and Maintenance sub-menu.

If you need additional help, please visit https://www.torbox.ch or contact us on our Github page (https://github.com/radio24/TorBox). You can also skip the next dialogue boxes if you know what you are doing.

Do you want to continue with the next dialogue boxes (the default is YES)?
