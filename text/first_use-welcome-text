Congratulation, you got TorBox running!

TorBox didn't connect the Tor network yet, but it will do so after the
next start-up dialogue boxes, which will ask you the following:
- if you want to use a (default) firewall circumvention method;
- from where the Internet is coming;
- if you want to activate the TorBox automatic counter actions and/or
  Vanguards;
- and if you want to use OBFS4 bridges.

We will ask you these questions only once, but you can configure these
settings (and much more) in the TorBox menu.

If you need additional help, please visit https://www.torbox.ch or contact us on our Github page (https://github.com/radio24/TorBox). You can also skip the next dialogue boxes if you know what you are doing.

Do you want to continue with the next dialogue boxes (the default is YES)?
