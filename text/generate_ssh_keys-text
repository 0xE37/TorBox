This menu entry will generate new private and public SSH keys, providing an easy, secure way to log into TorBox.

In the end, you will have two files in TorBox's home directory:
- id_rsa (Private Key): The private key must be downloaded on your client
  using SFTP (it uses the same login and password as your SSH client). To
  log into TorBox, you must use an SSH client that supports SSH key handling
  (for example, Termius). The key should be kept secure so that no other
  users on your computer can read the file.â€¨
- id_rsa.pub (Public Key). The public key will be placed on the TorBox.

IMPORTANT
- This menu entry doesn't disable password identification. However, you will
  find the according menu entry in the Danger Zone.
- Already existing SSH keys will be overwritten. If disabled, you may
  temporarily enable password identification to avoid the risk of being
  locked out. With replacing the public SSH key, you must replace and test
  the private key of your SSH client before you log out of the TorBox!
- Regardless of the use of SSH keys, the default passwords with entries 1
  and 3 should be changed in any case.
- WebSSH doesn't support SSH keys yet - coming soon!
