To circumvent sophisticated censorship, Tor introduced BRIDGES which support pluggable transports. These transports manipulate all Tor traffic between the client and its first hop such that it is not identifiable as a Tor connection. Currently, TorBox supports only OBFS4, because it is currently the most effective transport to bypass censorship.

IMPORTANT
- With this menu entry, you can activate the BRIDGE MODE of TorBox to
  bypass Tor blocking in your country. However, this helps to circumvent
  censorship; it doesn't help if a firewall blocks your network traffic.
- BRIDGE RELAY MODE will automatically be deactivated; the configuration will be kept for later re-activation.

You should only activate BRIDGE MODE if necessary because it complicates configuration and could lead to a less stable and slower data transfer speed. By default, BRIDGE MODE is deactivated.

Furthermore, you have to activate already configured bridges or add/replace additional bridges (menu entry 4 or 5). To take effect, finally, you have to restart tor (menu entry 9).
More information on how obtaining bridges can you find in the "ALL ABOUT BRIDGES - READ ME FIRST" menu entry.
