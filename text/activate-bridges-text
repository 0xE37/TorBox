To circumvent sophisticated censorship, Tor introduced BRIDGES, which supports pluggable transports. These transports manipulate all Tor traffic between the client and its first hop such that it is not identifiable as a Tor connection.

IMPORTANT
- This menu entry activates the OBFS4 BRIDGE MODE of TorBox to bypass
  Tor blocking in a country. It helps to circumvent censorship; however,
  it doesn't help if a firewall blocks the network traffic.
- If OBFS4 bridges don't help, try MEEK-AZURE or SNOWFLAKE (see menu
  entries below).
- BRIDGE RELAY MODE will automatically be deactivated; the configuration
  will be kept for later re-activation.

You should only activate the OBFS4 BRIDGE MODE if necessary. It could lead
to a less stable and slower data transfer speed. By default, the OBFS4
BRIDGE MODE is deactivated.

Furthermore, you have to activate already configured bridges or add additional bridges. To take effect, finally, you have to restart Tor (menu entry 9).
More information on how to obtain bridges can you find in the "ALL ABOUT BRIDGES - READ ME FIRST" menu entry.
