This menu entry will remove all bridges in the tor configuration, fetch and add bridges used as default built-in bridges in the TorBrowser.

TorBox is released with its built-in bridges, which were tested before the release. The user also can get new OBFS4 and Snowflake bridges by using the according entry in the Countermeasure sub-menu. However, if all fails and the user cannot catch valid bridges, the default built-in bridges could serve as a last resort.

If still working (for example, on a not censored network), TorBox will try to get the default bridges through Tor. If this is not possible, with the user's consent, TorBox will use Clearnet.

Are you sure to remove all existing bridges, fetch and add default built-in bridges?
