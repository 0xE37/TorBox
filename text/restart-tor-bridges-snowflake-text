You can (re)start tor and check the progress of building circuits. Depending on your network and the contacted bridge relay, this could last several minutes. Ignore all the error messages. At the end of that process, you should see "Bootstrapped 100%: Done". You can leave the progress report by pressing q.

IMPORTANT
To run properly, SNOWFLAKE has to resolve DNS requests and connect some URLs directly. It is not a problem because all client's DNS requests and data are still handled through the tor network. However, your network provider may see that you are using tor.

Are you ready to (re)start Tor now?
