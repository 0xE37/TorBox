This menu entry creates or reactivates an Onion Service. To do so, you must type in the service's name. If the service is not existing, it will be created (including a shared folder). If the service exists, it may be deactivated. You can try to reactivate it.

Along with the Onion Service, a virtual port has to be defined. However, don't worry about it; just type in a number you wish to use (good numbers are 80, 8080, or something above 10000).

Finally, when the Onion Service is successfully created, TorBox will present you with all the necessary information, including a QR code.

IMPORTANT
- Successfully creating or reactivating an Onion Service toggles the
  Onion Service Mode from OFF to ON, if not already done.
- However, the newly created Onion Service is not accessible right away.
  You still have to share the newly created folder (menu entry 17 or 18)
  or activate the chat secure function (menu entry 19) if not already
  done.
- Without client authorization (menu entry 7-11), shared folders and
  chat secure  will be publicly available if configured. If you want to
  restrict the client's access, you have to generate a key pair (menu
  entry 7), send the client his private key, or register a client's
  public key (menu entry 8) if he provides it.
