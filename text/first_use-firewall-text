Since 2021, the TorBox team observed more and more providers (especially
in connection with open hotspots), which extensively block ports, which
stays in the way of a proper working TorBox (tor commonly uses ports 80,
443, 9001 and 9030 for network traffic and directory information).

Therefore, TorBox uses by default countermeasures against a tightly
configured firewall taking care that tor uses only port 80 and 443
for its data stream. However, THIS CAN LEAD TO PROBLEMS IN CONNECTION
WITH THE USE OF BRIDGES and DOESN'T WORK WITH AN OBFS4 BRIDGE RELAY simultaneously.

Do you want to keep using the countermeasure against tightly configured
firewalls?
