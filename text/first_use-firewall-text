Since 2021, the TorBox team observed more and more providers (especially
in connection with open hotspots), which extensively block ports, which
stays in the way of a proper working TorBox (tor commonly uses ports 80,
443, 9001 and 9030 for network traffic and directory information).

Therefore, TorBox uses by default countermeasures against a tightly
configured firewall taking care that tor uses only port 80 and 443
for its data stream. We didn't observe any negative impact (nevertheless,
probably you should deactivate this feature if you run a bridge relay on
the TorBox).

Again, it is highly recommended to keep using the firewall countermeasure.

Do you want to keep using the countermeasure against tightly configured
firewalls?
