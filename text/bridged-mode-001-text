!!! ATTENTION !!! READ IT CAREFULLY !!!

Use this option only, if you are restricted to connect to the Tor network by censorship. It doesn't help you if you are behind a firewall which blocks all the network traffic. 

To circumvent sophisticated censorship, Tor introduced bridges which support pluggable transports. These transports manipulate all Tor traffic between the client and its first hop such that it is not identifiable as a Tor connection. 

You have two ways to get the necessary bridge-addresses (copy it in your notepad â€” you need them later):
1. Get them here https://bridges.torproject.org/ 
   (chose "Advanced Options", "obfs4" and press "Get Bridges)
2. Or send an email to bridges@torproject.org, using an address 
   from Riseup, Gmail or Yahoo with "get transport obfs4" in the 
   body of the mail.

Currently, it seems that certain bridge-addresses don't work. That's why it is still EXPERIMENTAL -- we still need to gain more experience. 

Did you get your bridge-addresses and are you ready to continue?
