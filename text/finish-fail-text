HMMM... THAT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD...

We couldn't check if your connection is now protected. However, BE PATIENT! Tor needs UP TO ONE MINUTE to establish the necessary circuits -- check with main menu entry 4, "Display the Tor log file" in the main menu.

If this doesn't help, you may have to choose the Internet source again (main menu 5-10) or even reboot TorBox. You can also manually check if TorBox is working and if your connection is being protected. To do so, open on one of your clients a web browser and try to access the following address:

                      https://check.torproject.org

Finally, you should read: "Congratulations. This browser is configured to use Tor." ONLY IN THIS CASE IS YOUR CONNECTION PROTECTED !!

"PROTECTED" means that all data from your devices connected with TorBox is encrypted and tunnelled through Tor. It may be sufficient to protect others from spying on your internet traffic or to circumvent censorship measures. However, staying anonymous is more challenging. For example, in this case, you should exclusively use Tor Browser while browsing the web to withhold some information about your computer's configuration. You can download it here: https://goo.gl/2UwZmR or on Telegram using the @gettor_bot.

You shouldn't use TorBox if your life or well-being depends on data security/anonymity. In this case, you should instead use Tails: https://tails.boum.org/
