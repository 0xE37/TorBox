With this menu entry, you can deactivate the OBFS4 bridges for TorBox.
This is the default.

However, the bridges will not be deleted, you can activate again these bridges -- no need to worry ;-)

In the end, Tor automatically restarts - no need to do it again.

Would you like to DEACTIVATE the OBFS4 bridges for TorBox?
