With this menu entry, you can deactivate the OBFS4 BRIDGE MODE of TorBox.
This is the default.

Furthermore, in the end, all configured bridges are deactivated.
However, the bridges will not be deleted. If you activate the OBFS4 BRIDGE MODE again, you can activate again these bridges -- no need to worry ;-)

In the end, Tor automatically restarts - no need to do it again.

Would you like to DEACTIVATE the OBFS4 BRIDGE MODE of TorBox?
