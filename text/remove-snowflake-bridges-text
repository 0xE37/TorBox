This menu entry DELETES all or specific SNOWFLAKE BRIDGES from TorBox. However, Snowflake Bridges are necessary for TorBox to bypass Tor blocking in a country. To use this feature of TorBox, you need to have at least one Snowflake bridge.

IMPORTANT
If you delete ALL Snowflake bridges, TorBox will directly connect to the Tor network, which is the default. However, instead of deleting Snowflake bridges, we recommend simply to deactivate Snowflake.
