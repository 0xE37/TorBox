Would you like to update / reset your TorBox configuration files?

IMPORTANT
- You didn't select menu entry 4 to update to the newest stable version of
  TorBox. This means that we will use the currently downloaded configuration
  files (stored under ~/torbox/etc).
- All configuration files will be overwritten, and all your custom
  configuration will be lost!!
