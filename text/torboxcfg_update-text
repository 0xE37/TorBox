Would you like to update / reset your TorBox configuration files?

IMPORTANT
- If you didn't select menu entry 4 to update to the newest stable version of
  TorBox, the currently downloaded configuration files (stored under
  ~/torbox/etc) would be used.
- ALL configuration files will be overwritten, and ALL your custom
  configuration will be lost!!
