!!! ATTENTION !!! READ IT CAREFULLY !!!

The default behavior of TorBox is to create a wireless network, with which clients can connect. With this menu entry, TorBox expects that your client is connected with a cable only. If you proceed, TorBox stops working as an access point until you choose the "Undo the connection to a cable-client" entry.

IMPORTANT
- Choosing this menu entry changes the basic configuration of your TorBox
  and shut it down.
- After the shutdown, you have to connect TorBox with a cable to its
  client. The client has to be connected with the ethernet connector fix
  assembled on the board (eth0). The internet is accessed either via a
  USB ethernet adapter, a wireless network or tethering with an iPhone.
- After the shutdown, you cannot connect your TorBox with a wireless
  client --> you need a cable-client to undo the configuration.
- You have to undo the cable-client connection before you can access TorBox
  again with a wireless client !!
