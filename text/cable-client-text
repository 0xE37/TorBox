!!! ATTENTION !!! READ IT CAREFULLY !!!

The default behaviour of TorBox is to create a wireless network, with which clients can connect. With this menu entry, TorBox expects that your client will be connected with a cable only. If you proceed, TorBox will stop working as an access point until you choose the "Undo the connection to a cable-client" entry.

IMPORTANT 
- Choosing this menu entry will change the basic configuration of your 
  TorBox and shut it down.
- After the shut down, you have to connect TorBox with a cable to its 
  client. For that, you need a USB-ethernet adapter.
- After the shut down, you will not be able to connect your TorBox with 
  a wireless client --> you need a cable-client to undo the configuration.
- You have to undo the cable-client connection before you can acces TorBox 
  again with a wireless client !!
