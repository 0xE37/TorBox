This menu entry starts, stops or lists TorBox File Sharing (TFS) on Onion domains. The difference to serving a website folder on Onion domains (menu entry 17) is that TFS is focused on exchanging files, not serving a website.

IMPORTANT
- To use TFS, you have first to toggle the Onion Service Mode from OFF to
  ON and/or create an Onion Service (menu entry 2 or 3).
- Without client authorization (menu entry 7-11), you will share the
  website folder with ANYONE. If you don't want that, control the
  client's access first.

Do you want to start, stop or list TFS on Onion domains?
