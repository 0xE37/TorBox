Onion Service allows easily and securely sharing of data through Tor, even if TorBox is located behind firewalls, network address translators or placed in a censoring country, while preserving the security and anonymity of both parties. How this is accomplished, see here: https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/overview/

To use Onion Services, you can follow a 3-STEP PROCEDURE:
1. Toggle the Onion Service Mode from OFF to ON or create an Onion
   Service (menu entry 2 or 3). It will give you a public Onion
   Service - everyone can access it.
2. If you want to limit access to your Onion Service, you can control
   the client's access by generating a key pair (menu entry 7),
   sending the client his private key or registering a client's public
   key (menu entry 8) if he is providing you with it.
3. Start (or stop) sharing a folder on an Onion domain
   (menu entry 17 or 18).

Managing access to a server (optional)
If your TorBox is the client, which should connect to an Onion Service
with a client access authorization, you can manage access to this
server with the menu entries 12-16. If configured, this will not only
give the TorBox itself access, but also all client devices, which data
traffic is routed through the TorBox (after an initial delay of about 30').
