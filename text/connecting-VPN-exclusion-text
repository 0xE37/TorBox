Currently, you are not connected to a VPN. Only the domains on the "clearnet list" will be handled. The domains on the "VPN list" will be routed through tor for security reasons.

When possible, we recommend that domains excluded from routing through tor are routed through a VPN. If you agree, we will connect the TorBox to a VPN so that the local network data from the command prompt and the domains in the "CLEARNET" and "VPN list" are routed through VPN.

Client network data not on these lists will still be routed through tor using the interface highlighted in the main menu.

IMPORTANT
- To use this menu entry, you have first to put one or more *.ovpn-files
  in the ~/openvpn directory so that TorBox can execute OpenVPN with
  that file.

Would you like to connect to a VPN?
