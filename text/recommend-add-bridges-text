Congratulation, you got TorBox running!

TorBox didn't connect the Tor network yet, but it will do so after this 
dialogue box. In a highly authoritarian country, that may be risky because 
connecting the tor network could be seen as suspicious. OBFS4 bridges with 
pluggable transports hide the connection to the tor network. However, we 
recommend only using this option if necessary because it is slower and 
doesn't work if you are behind a tight configured firewall.

Choosing this option, TorBox tries to activate its internal OBFS4 bridges. 
If this fails, we will start the Countermeasure sub-menu so that you can 
try SNOWFLAKE or MEEK as well as manually add new OBFS4 bridge information.

Again, we highlight that if your well-being depends on your anonymity, it 
is strongly advised not to use TorBox, but Tails!

Are you located in a highly authoritarian country and want to ACTIVATE 
OBFS4 bridges with pluggable transports for TorBox (default is NO)?
