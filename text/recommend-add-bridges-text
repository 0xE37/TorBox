Congratulation, you got TorBox running!

So far, we didn't establish contact with the Tor network, but will do so
after this dialogue box. In an highly authoritarian country that may be
risky because the ISP may caught your tor connections, which could be
looked as suspicous. For such situations and to circumvent sophisticated
censorship, Tor introduced BRIDGES, which supports pluggable transports.
These transports manipulate all Tor traffic between the client and its first
hop such that it is not identifiable as a Tor connection.

First we try to activate TorBox's already added OBFS4 bridges. If that fails,
we will start the Countermeasure sub-menu, so that you can try SNOWFLAKE or
MEEK as well as manually add new OBFS4 bridge information.

We highlight it again: If your well-being depends on your anonymity, it is
strongly advised not to use TorBox, but Tails!

Are you located in a highly authoritarian country and want to ACTIVATE OBFS4
bridges for TorBox?
