With this menu entry, you can define domain names (for example, netflix.com), which will be accessed directly or through a VPN and not through tor.

This option may be a solution for sites blocking requests from tor exit nodes or unproblematic streaming sites.

However, this comes with the risk that you will leak information and location! Therefore, we highly advise against using this option in authoritarian countries! If you communicate with such a site, you have to assume that everyone will see that and may also see the content of the communication!
