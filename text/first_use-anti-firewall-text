We are sorry that the activation of tor with OBFS4 bridges failed. If you
are located in China, Iran, Russia or Turkmenistan, we recommend to use
SNOWFLAKE instead (see: https://github.com/radio24/TorBox/discussions/179).

TOR commonly uses ports 80, 443, 9001 and 9030 for network traffic and
directory information. A tightly configured firewall or our countermeasures
against it could also lead to problems.

Do you want to try to change the status of the anti-firewall countermeasure
or quit to the Countermeasure sub-menu to deactivate or reconfigure OBFS4
respectively to activate SNOWFLAKE / MEEK-AZURE?
