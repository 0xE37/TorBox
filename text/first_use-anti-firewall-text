We are sorry that the activation of tor with bridges failed. If you used OBFS4, we recommend giving SNOWFLAKE a try, especially if you are located in China, Iran, Russia or Turkmenistan (see: https://github.com/radio24/TorBox/discussions/179).

However, there is another possibility of failing to get a connection. Tor commonly uses ports 80, 443, 9001 and 9030 for network traffic and directory information. A tightly configured firewall or TorBox's countermeasures against it could also lead to problems.

Do you want to try to change the status of the anti-firewall countermeasure or quit to the Countermeasure sub-menu to switch between OBFS4, SNOWFLAKE and MEEK-AZURE and try different configurations?
