This menu entry will disable SSH password login.

Especially after generating and testing SSH keys to log into TorBox without a password, disabling the SSH password login is advisable.

IMPORTANT
Disabling SSH password login is only possible if SSH keys are generated, and the public key is on the TorBox ready to work.

Are you ready to disable TorBox's SSH password?
